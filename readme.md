# redux-react-boilerplate

This is my personal redux + react boilerplate.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:akoenig/boilerplate-redux-react.git

cd boilerplate-redux-react
npm i
```

This will install the following stack:

  * `react`
  * `react-dom`
  * `react-redux`
  * `redux`
  * `redux-actions`
  * `redux-thunk`

## Usage

This boilerplate utilizes webpack for establishing a smooth development workflow. `smooth` because of the integration of `react-hot-loader` which brings reloading capabilities without destroying your current state. Anyway, enough words. You can experience all that later. For the moment, you only have to execute:

```sh
npm start
```

That's all. It will start a development HTTP server on-the-fly. Just fire up your web browser and point it to `http://localhost:3000`. Browse the codebase, which you find in the `lib/` directory btw., make some changes and enjoy the hot module capabilities of the `react-hot-loader`.

If you have any questions or suggestions, drop me an [issue](https://github.com/akoenig/boilerplate-redux-react/issues/new).

Enjoy.
